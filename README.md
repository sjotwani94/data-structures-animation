# data-structures-animation
This Product has visualizations of 3 data structures: Stack, Queue and Circular Queue. Each structure is visualized by various buttons. Maximum 8 elements can be entered at a time. The product is easy to operate, fast to load and to the point. Attractive graphics (thanks to CSS) and simple operations are intended to keep learners focused.

The product runs smoothly on numerous browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Internet explorer and Google Chrome. However, for best experience, latest version of Google Chrome is recommended. Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox fell behind in getting expected output. For best visualization, 1024 x 768 screen resolutions is recommended. There are no special hardware requirements.
